What am I looking for in a team and at my next job?
---
I am searching for a work environment with a positive team culture and strong collaboration. As of now, my experience has largely been in the food delivery sector. However, I am excited about the idea of tackling challenges in different areas. Personally, I am an avid user of Reddit and have always been interested in its product. It stands out due to its impressive, user-generated content. I am eager to further understand this platform and contribute to its improvement.

Think about your past work experience, what is something you liked most about the processes in place and something you did not like?

Reflecting on my previous roles at Uber and CloudKitchens, I particularly appreciated the robust engineering culture. Guided by the principle to 'move fast and break thingsâ€™ allowed us to innovate quickly while maintaining product stability through rigorous unit and integration testing. However, a drawback I've experienced is the frequent shift in focus. While it can occasionally be beneficial to adapt and change, it can also be frustrating when prolonged periods are needed to address complex issues. This recurrent shift in focus every quarter is one of the main reasons I am looking for new opportunities.


Talk broadly about a project you worked on.

I'm currently involved in a fascinating project named Boost. The essence of Boost is to aid restaurant owners by recommending promotional strategies for the following day to optimize their sales. My role in this project is pivotal, as I oversee two crucial components.

Firstly, I handle the model aspect, which involves curating an end-to-end data pipeline alongside model training. This foundation is critical for generating accurate forecasts that drive our decision-making process. Secondly, I manage the engine segment of the project. This part is particularly interesting because it utilizes the model's predictions on potential order volumes under various promotional scenarios. Based on these predictions, my task is to intelligently distribute a predefined budget across different stores. The allocation strategy is designed to maximize overall order volume for the restaurant owner, ensuring that each promotion delivers the best possible outcome. This project not only highlights the technical complexities of predictive modeling and budget optimization but also showcases the real-world impact of our work on business operations.


What is something you learned from the project?
---
The project taught me the importance of cross-collaboration, especially with Operations and Sales, and the ability to assertively push back when necessary. The product we are developing is currently being tested with multiple large enterprises, and we constantly receive a barrage of feature requests from product management. At times, these requests can be somewhat ambiguous, leading me to reach out to product management for clarification.

I learned to insist on being included in key meetings with Operations and customers to gain a better understanding of the reasons behind these requests. Armed with this information, we could then have meaningful discussions to prioritize these feature requests effectively and plan our workflow.

From this experience, I learned that accepting orders from product management without question can be counterproductive. A more efficient approach involves dedicating time to gain insight into the rationale behind each feature request and not hesitating to push back when something seems off or unnecessary.


Talk about a time where you couldn't meet a deadline.
---
Due to the nature of how our teams are generally organized, we have a strong dependency on a team in a different org. This team is essential for executing integrations with various delivery platforms, which was a crucial element for the project at hand. We initiate our planning through a Quarterly Planning Request (QPR) process, where we outline our needs and timeline requirements.

For Q1, we had requested their assistance in implementing an advertisement integration. After discussing the scope and effort required, we confidently set our project timeline and communicated these commitments to our customers. However, in mid-Q2, an unexpected priority shift within the integration team came to light during our weekly sync. Such changes were not uncommon, but the timing significantly impacted our project timeline.

Realizing the impossibility of meeting our initial deadline, we promptly re-evaluated our position. Understanding the importance of transparency and effective communication in these situations, we immediately contacted our Operations team. The Operations team plays a key role in maintaining regular contact with our customers, making them the ideal channel for communicating this update. We informed them of the delay, provided a revised timeline, and committed to sharing weekly progress updates. This ensured that both our team and our customers had a clear and current view of the project's status. This experience underscored the importance of flexibility, clear communication, and keeping stakeholders informed during project management.



Talk about a case where you helped a coworker.
---
In my current company, we mostly hire senior engineers and above so we dont really have too many mentoring opportunities. But I have been actively helping and mentoring several colleges who are interested in machine learning. There is one coworker that we worked on a pricing project together in the past. He personally is interested in machine learning and experiment designs. After that project, he moved to another team to work on something else. But we still keep in touch and during our 1:1s, we always talk about the techinical challenges he is facing and jamming about the experiment designs and model designs. I am also learning a lot from this back n forth discussions.


Why are you looking for a new job?
---
The continous shifting focus is one reason. Sometimes it is a good thing if your project scope is quarterly and you can move fast. But when the project is planned for more than one quarter, it will be quite frustrated. I have complained this to my manager and eng leads. But unforutately the direction change is top down. Another reason is that i have stayed in this company for four years and i am looking forward to take some new challenges and explore new things.
