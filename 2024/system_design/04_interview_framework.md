# Step 1: Understand and establish design scope
- features
- user scale and user characteristics
- performance
- existing tech stack to reuse

# Step 2: High level design and reach consensus
- draft the blueprint and ask for feedback
    - Boxes of the key components
    - back of envelope to support the blueprint if necessary


# Step 3: Deep dive
Checklist:
- overall goals and featurs agreed
- high level blueprint available
- iterated the blueprint based on the feedback
- initial ideas on the areas to focus on


Examples of focus areas
- high level design
- system performance characteristics
- details of certain system components

Remember to show case your strong parts/skills


# Wrap up
- Current design's system bottlenecks and discuss improvements
- Recap of the design
- Failure modes: server failure, network loss
- Operational issues: monitoring, alerting, rolling out
- What to change to support the next scale
- Other refinements you missed earlier



Things to keep in mind
- ask for clarification, no assumption
- understand the problem requirements before proceed
- there are multiple solutions, think openly and suggest multiple approaches
- think out loud to let the interviewer to know what you are thinking
- agree on blueprints and then design the most critical components first
- treat interviewer as your collaborator


Things to avoid
- Come unprepared for typical intervie questions
- Jump too quick into the solution without understanding the requirements
- Do top down, high level first, then details
- stuck then plz ask for hints
- communicate
