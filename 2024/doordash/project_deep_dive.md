The project I have worked on is a product helping restaurants to pick optimal promotions and advertisement settings on the delivery platforms to maximize their revenue. It mainly has two components:
1. Modeling: we need to make accurate predictions for various promotion and adverstisement settings to estimate the order volume, spend on promotions and spend on advertisement.
2. Optimization: The straightforward way to understand it is to enumerate all the combos and find the optimal one. If customer doesnt have a budget, this is a straight ranking problem. But if they have a limited budget, we will need to convert it into a mixed integer programming problem to make it more efficient.
